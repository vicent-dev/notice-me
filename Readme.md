# notice-me

### ⚠️🛠️⚠️🛠️⚠️🛠️️ Project under construction ⚠️🛠️⚠️🛠️⚠️🛠️️ 

Notice-me is a server (golang) / client (js) microservice that allows you to implement 
frontend async notifications from your backend system/s via websockets.

Create notifications from frontend or other backend service and notify to all clients available.
(custom header to discriminate notification types/users?)

TODO: 
- basic CRUD notifications via http/cli/amqp.
- cli tool to run backend websocket.
- react components to easy implement async notifications.
- react components for CRUD (optional).
